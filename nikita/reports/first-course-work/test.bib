abstract = {Reservoir Geophysics: Applications covers the application and impact of seismic data on oil and gas reservoirs. The material, based on the 2008 SEG/EAGE Distinguished Instructor Short Course, shows how geoscientists use seismic data to determine critical reservoir characteristics in the stages of project life from delineation through secondary recovery. The text describes the main business drivers of the operator and how seismic data help address subsurface uncertainties for business purposes. The book discusses delineation, development, production, and geophysics applications in heavy-oil and carbonate reservoirs. Also included are two hands-on student problems based on actual projects. Illustrations include examples that focus on business value. The book will be of interest to geoscientists, managers, and operators.  The book covers the relationship between the business opportunity of the petroleum operator and the application of seismic data to provide valuable subsurface information.},

abstract = {We have developed an extension of the mixture-density neural network as a computationally efficient probabilistic method to solve nonlinear inverse problems. In this method, any postinversion (a posteriori) joint probability density function (PDF) over the model parameters is represented by a weighted sum of multivariate Gaussian PDFs. A mixture-density neural network estimates the weights, mean vector, and covariance matrix of the Gaussians given any measured data set. In one study, we have jointly inverted compressional- and shear-wave velocity for the joint PDF of porosity, clay content, and water saturation in a synthetic, fluid-saturated, dispersed sand-shale system. Results show that if the method is applied appropriately, the joint PDF estimated by the neural network is comparable to the Monte Carlo sampled a posteriori solution of the inverse problem. However, the computational cost of training and using the neural network is much lower than inversion by sampling (more than a factor of 10 4 in this case and potentially a much larger factor for 3D seismic inversion). To analyze the performance of the method on real exploration geophysical data, we have jointly inverted P-wave impedance and Poisson's ratio logs for the joint PDF of porosity and clay content. Results show that the posterior model PDF of porosity and clay content is a good estimate of actual porosity and clay-content log values. Although the results may vary from one field to another, this fast, probabilistic method of solving nonlinear inverse problems can be applied to invert well logs and large seismic data sets for petrophysical parameters in any field.},

The wavelet transform is applied to a set of well-log data for identifying correlations between wavelet coefficients and lithofacies sequences. Our results indicate that the scales, in a multiscale analysis, are related to the rock thickness and depending on the scale used it is possible to identify other particular or general sequences. The results obtained are compared and corroborated by standard geological procedures for lithological characterization, indicating that the wavelet analysis provides qualitative guides for the identification of lithological properties in wells. All our analyses are based on a siliciclastic oil field that belongs to Chicontepec Formation of the Tampico-Misantla basin in Mexico. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences. In the Hamersley Ranges of Western Australia, highly consistent marker shales are used to identify the stratigraphic location of the banded iron formation (BIF) or BIF-hosted ore. These marker shales produce distinctive signatures in the natural gamma downhole logs, which are currently processed by slow manual interpretation. The location of the marker shales is important when distinguishing lithology for geological and ore body mapping. Previously, two methods of automatically identifying these shales in the natural gamma logs have been proposed, using either Gaussian processes (GP) or dynamic time warping (DTW). There are advantages and disadvantages with each method and a combined result is desirable. However, the outputs from each technique are very different and cannot be directly combined. This paper proposes a method of standardizing the results to the same scale and combining them using a weighted average. The method is tested using two natural gamma signatures from a deposit that contains the Marra Mamba sequence of the Hamersley province. The results showed that the combined method outperforms both individual methods. The GP has accuracies of 87.0 to 92.0 {\%}, increasing to 92.9 to 95.7 {\%} when the method is certain. The DTW has accuracies of 90.0 to 90.6 {\%}, increasing to 94.0 to 95.4 {\%} when the method is certain. In comparison, the combined method has accuracies of 90.7 to 93.6 {\%}, increasing to 94.4 to 95.9 {\%} when this method is certain. The combined method balances the strengths of the individual methods, identifying a larger number of positive signatures than the GP, while retaining a higher classification accuracy for these signatures than the DTW.},

abstract = {Rock typing is critical in deepwater reservoir characterization to construct stratigraphic models populated with static and dynamic petrophysical properties. Rock typing based on multiple well logs is subject to large uncertainty in thinly bedded reservoirs because true physical properties cannot be resolved by low-resolution logging tools due to shoulder-bed effects. We have introduced a new Bayesian approach that inherently adopts the scientific method of iterative hypothesis testing to perform rock typing by simultaneously honoring different logging-tool physics in a multilayered earth model. In addition to estimating the vertical distribution of rock types with maximum likelihood, the Bayesian method quantifies the uncertainty of rock types and the associated petrophysical properties layer by layer. Bayesian rock classification is performed with a fast sampling technique based on the Markov-chain Monte Carlo method, thereby enabling an efficient search of rock types to obtain the final results. We have used a fast linear iterative refinement method to simulate nuclear logs and a 2D forward modeling code to simulate array-induction resistivity logs. A rock-type distribution hypothesis is considered acceptable only when all the observed well logs are reproduced with forward modeling. In a field case of offshore deltaic gas reservoir, the Bayesian method differentiates rock types that exhibit subtle petrophysical variations due to grain size change. The new method provides more than 77{\%} agreement between log- and core-derived rock types, whereas conventional deterministic methods achieve only 60{\%} agreement due to the presence of thin beds and laminations. Even though large uncertainty is observed in thinly bedded and laminated zones, the Bayesian rock-typing method still yields rock types and petrophysical properties that agree well with core-plug measurements acquired in these layers. As a result, the overall correlation between log-derived permeability and core-measured permeability is improved by approximately 16{\%} when compared with conventional deterministic methods.},

abstract = {Fracture is the main pore space for volcanic reservoir, serving as the controlling factor of reservoir productivity. Conventional well logging data often fail to fracture characterization and classification in volcanic reservoir since the degree or extent of the fracture development varies in scales in different locations. A method for fracture developing degree discrimination, based on a combinational algorithm of kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (KPCA-MFDFA), is proposed. The first kernel principal component (KPC-1), mostly characterizing the reservoir property, is extracted from conventional well logging data. Multifractal parameters, such as multifractal dimension, mass exponent, multifractal spectrum, and singularity strength, are calculated by MFDFA. A cross-plot between the maximum multifractal dimension difference and range of singularity strength is established to investigate the relationships between multifractal parameters and fracture developing degree.},

However, due to inherent complexity of the signals (such as highly heterogeneous deep-water sedimentary sequences) lithology recognition is not straightforward. We used a rescaled range analysis, calibrated with cores, to recognize lithological patterns from signal recorded along wireline logs. The detected intervals coincide with zones of visual electro-facies associations proposed by geologist well-log interpreters. In addition, we propose a rescaled range multifractal analysis to identify ranges of well-log signal complexities, which could be related to sedimentary process variations at specific stratigraphic order cycles.},
